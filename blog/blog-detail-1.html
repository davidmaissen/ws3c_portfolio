                    In the last few weeks, many of us have become pros at using online meetings. Those who are not yet,
                    now have the chance to remedy the situation with the online whiteboard Miro and finally organize
                    their creative thoughts again in the form of Post-its and Co.

                <div class="block content is-medium">
                    At first glance, Miro appears so versatile that it is difficult to describe the possibilities in a
                    few words. The description "Google Docs for meetings and workshops" is probably the most
                    appropriate. The online whiteboard can be used to record ideas, develop concepts and exchange
                    information within the team. The application options range from simple meetings to extensive
                    workshops - all with real-time editing by the entire team.

                    <h2 class="title is-2">Boards as a playground for teams</h2>
                    <p>The basic framework of Miro are the so-called boards, on which the actual collaboration takes
                        place and which can be managed in a clear dashboard. A board - in other words, a huge digital
                        surface - can be created with just a few clicks and then designed or even defaced according to
                        your own wishes. To prevent the latter from happening, Miro provides a variety of templates that
                        map well-known frameworks like Kanban or creativity methods like brainwriting. If all this is
                        not enough, you can also define your own templates and share them with the team.

                    <h2 class="title is-2">Order through frames</h2>
                    <p>If you want to create order on the board, you can divide the area with frames and thus separate
                        individual topics or focal points from one another. Frames also offer the advantage that they
                        can be
                        exported in various file formats such as JPG or PDF.


                        Frames can be used to delimit and structure individual topics. Any number of frames and
                        templates can be placed on a board.

                        The user interface of Miro appears well structured and tidy. Nevertheless, numerous tools are
                        available that are intuitive to use. The text tool can be used to compose or insert texts. A
                        freehand tool literally cries out for creative input from teammates. A classic can be found with
                        the
                        so-called sticky notes, which also deserve the name in this case. Like their analog
                        counterparts,
                        the notes can be enriched with information and attached - with the difference that the digital
                        post-its always stick. If you want to go one step further, you can create complex charts and use
                        tags to create additional structures. Videos, web pages and PDFs can also be embedded with ease.

                    <p>With Cards, tasks can be added to the board, given a date and assigned to the appropriate team
                        member. Working with Cards offers the advantage that they can be viewed like frames in a
                        detailed navigation and filtered by the respective user.

                    <p>The view of the board alone is fascinating, as the various team members buzz around the workspace
                        like busy bees and the board takes on new forms. In addition to this real-time editing, simple
                        comments, a text and video chat, sreensharing and, last but not least, the possibility for
                        voting are available. To prevent team members from getting lost in the board and forgetting the
                        time, a timer can also be set. Of course, a board can also be shared with external circles via a
                        link.
